# Volunteer To Earn

- Site: https://volunteertoearn.netlify.app/


## Inspiration
Volunteers are a tremendous resource for charitable nonprofits. They help nonprofits to conduct programs, raise funds, or serve clients to make our communities and society better.

On other hand, ESG movement has been gaining momentum. They look for ways to improve their ESG profile.

Our platform enables socially responsible companies to reward any volunteer anywhere.

## What it does
First, charities could use our Dapp to create volunteer hour receipt thatâ€™s represented by NFT

Then, volunteers could exchange their volunteer hour NFT for DoGood tokens, and redeem their tokens for rewards.

These rewards are provided by companies. In return, they develop positive publicity and enhance their ESG profile. They could even do marketing campaign.

After all, our reward ecosystem incentivizes people to volunteer more hours, thus benefiting charities.

## How we build it
Contracts are developed using Truffle and deployed to Rinkeby Testnet.  UI is built with Next.js and ant.design.

## How we used IPFS
We used web3.storage to store volunteer data on IPFS and store CID in NFT
